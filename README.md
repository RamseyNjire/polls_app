# README

This is a polls app with users who can author and respond to polls, polls which have multiple questions, which in turn have multiple answer choices, which may be picked by users in a response.

I won't be building a user interface for this app. In fact, most of the work is within the models folder (in the app folder) and the db folder, where I'll write migrations and seeds for the db. The whole point of this exercise is to help me master Active Record, not to use as a production app.
